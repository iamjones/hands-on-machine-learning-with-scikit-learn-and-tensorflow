Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow

Chapter 1

1.
How would you define Machine Learning?

A process that takes some data as input and identifies patterns in the data so it can classify new data based on data the process was trained with.

2.
Can you name four types of problems where it shines?

- Speech recognition
- Computer vision

3.
What is a labeled training set?

The data in a labeled training will have a label set to define something about the data.

For example captcha images with the text that is written in the image. With this data you could train a model to solve captchas.

4.
What are the two most common supervised tasks?

- Regression
- Classification

5.
Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?

- Clustering
- Visualisation
- Rule learning
- Anomaly detection

6.
What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?

Reinforcement Learning. This will give the ability for the robot to take actions and record the outcomes so after the robot has been trained it will know what action to take based on the environment.

7.
What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?

Clustering. You would be able to group the customers by some attribute.

8.
Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning?

Supervised or semi-supervised because you need labeled data or someone telling the algorithm what is spam so it can learn over time.

9.
What is an online learning system?

A learning system that is retrained as new data is classified. An example of an online learning system is k-means. New data can be added as it is classfied to make successive calls more accurate.

10.
What is out-of-core learning?

When you have a dataset that is too large to fit into a computers memory.

11.
What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?

Unsupervised

12.
What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithms hyperparameter?

A model parameters are what the model will try and predict where as the hyperparameter controls the amount of regularisation the learning algorithm has.
